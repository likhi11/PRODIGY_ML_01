# Task 01 - House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on their square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

## Dataset
The dataset is from the Kaggle competition: [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

## Features Used
- GrLivArea: Above ground living area (sq ft)
- BedroomAbvGr: Number of bedrooms
- FullBath: Number of full bathrooms

## Instructions
1. Download and extract the dataset from Kaggle.
2. Place the `train.csv` file in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script using Python.

## Output
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score are printed.
- A scatter plot shows actual vs predicted house prices.

## Requirements
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
